## Problem

According to the discussion on the following issue:
https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/issues/21883

During network congestion, many transactions in the network cannot be processed 
because they all want to write lock similar accounts. 
When a write lock on an account is taken by a transaction batch no other batch 
can use this account in parallel, so only transactions belonging to a single batch 
are processed correctly and all others are forwarded to the leader of the next slot. 
There are multiple accounts of OpenBook (formerly serum), mango markets, etc which 
are used in high-frequency trading. During the event of extreme congestion we observe 
that specialized trading programs write lock these accounts but never CPI into the respecitve 
programs unless they can extract profit, effectively starving the actual users for access. 
Penalizing this behaviour with runtime fees collected by validators can create a perverse 
incentive to artificially delay HFT transactions, cause them to fail and charge penalty fees.

## Solution

As a high-performance cluster, we want to incentivize players which feed the network 
with correctly formed transactions instead of spamming the network. Introduction 
of application fees would be interesting way to penalize the bad actors and applications 
can rebate these fees to the good actors. This means the application has to decide who to 
rebate and who to penalize through lamport transfers. In particular it needs to be able to 
penalize, even if the application is not CPI'd to. There are multiple possible approaches 
to provide the application with access to transfer lamports outside of the regular cpi 
execution context:

1. A new specialized fee collection mechanism that uses per account meta-data to encode 
additional fees. Lamports should be collected on the actual accounts until claimed by 
their owner. Account owners can trigger a per account rebate on the fee collected 
during a transaction. Two strategies have been proposed:

    1. Create PDAs of the application program to store fee settings

        1. Concern is well encapsulated and implementation can be easily modified (**+**)
        2. Overhead for loading a lot of PDAs might be high (**---**)
        3. Hard to calculate fee for a message (**-**)

    2. **Extend existing account structure in ledger to store fee settings and collect lamports**

        1. High efficiency, minimal performance impact (**++**)
        2. Accounts structure is difficult to modify (**-**)
        3. Easier to calculate fees for a message (**+**)
    POC is implemented using this method.

1. A generic execution phase that gets invoked for every program account passed to a 
transaction. Programs would optionally contain a fee entry-point in their binary 
code that gets invoked with a list of all accessed account keys and their lock 
status. Programs would need access to a new sysvar identifying the transaction fee 
payer to rebate lamports to, to prevent breaking API changes for clients.

    1. Highest degree of flexibility for programs (**++**)
    2. Least data structures modified in runtime (**++**)
    3. Does not allow guarding non-pda accounts (e.g. an end-users signer key) (**-**)
    4. Allowing program execution that continues on failure might invite users to 
implement unforseen side-effects inside the fee entry-point (**---**)
    5. Very hard to calculate fees for a message (**--**)


### Application fees in working

As an owner of a writable account that is used a lot in the network, a program can use 
the application fees program to assign it an application fee. This application fee is 
applied to every transaction which will try to lock the account in writable mode. 
This means even if the transaction eventually fails the application fee will be charged
 to the payer.

These application fees will be tracked by the bank as it is running transaction batches
 and eventually when the bank is frozen it will dispatch all the application fees that 
 were collected to the respective writable accounts. Then the owners of the writable 
 accounts can collect these fees directly from the writable accounts.

Programs/Owners can also invoke or cpi instructions like Rebate or RebateAll to effectively 
cancel this application fee for good actors. So in the end application fee won't be charged 
to these actors. The rebate will be effective only if the transaction is executed and it 
wont be effective if the transaction fails.

We would like to limit the update of application fee for an account only once per slot. 
When the application fees are updated they will be taken into account at the next slot.

### Application fee program

A new native solana program with id `App1icationFees1111111111111111111111111111` will handle 
updating and rebating the application fees. It will have following instructions : 

#### UpdateFees
This instruction will update application fees for a writable account. Internally it will 
create a pda for a writable account (if the pda does not exists) and update with the fees 
information. If the fees is set to 0 the program will deallocate the pda.
It requires : 
* Owner of the writable account (signer)
* Writable account (writable)


#### Rebate
This instruction will remove fees for a writable account in a transaction.
It requires : 
* Owner of the writable account (signer)
* Writable account (writable)

#### Rebate all
This instruction will remove all the fees from all the writable accounts belonging to a owner.
It requires :
* Owner (signer)


## POC
A draft proof of concept has been implemented. \
It has been implemented by modifying the account structure to add has_application_fees boolean and \
replacing existing rent_epoch with rent_epoch_and_application_fees as rent_epoch is being deprecated \
and soon will no longer be used we use it to store application_fees. This add a condition that application fees \
cannot be applied to accounts which are not rent free.

## Example contract

Here is an working example to test application fees with a smart contract (work in progress).
[Example](git@github.com:godmodegalactus/paper-clip-maximizer.git)

## Mango V4 Usecase
With this feature implemented Mango-V4 will be able to charge users who spam risk-free aribitrage 
or spam liquidations by increasing application fees on perp-markets, token banks 
and mango-user accounts.
#### Perp markets
Application fees on perp liquidations, perp place order, perp cancel, perp consume, perp settle fees.
Rebates on : successful liquidations, consume events, HFT marketmaking refresh 
(cancel all, N* place POST, no IOC).

#### Token vaults
Application fees on openorderbook liquidations, deposit, withdrawals.
Rebate on successful liquidations, place IOC & fill in isolation, HFT marketmaking 
refresh (cancel all, N* place POST, no IOC).

#### Mango accounts 
Application fees on all liquidity transactions, consume events, settle pnl, all user 
signed transactions.
Rebate on transaction signed by owner or delegate, successful liquidations, 
settlements, consume events.
