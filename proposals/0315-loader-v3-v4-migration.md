## Summary

Migration of loader-v3 programs to loader-v4.

## Motivation

In order to remove the issues of loader-v3 (mentioned in SIMD-0167) from
validator implementations, all remaining loader-v3 must be migrated to
loader-v4.

## Alternatives Considered

None.

## New Terminology

None.

## Detailed Design

The feature gate must:

- enable loader-v4 `LoaderV411111111111111111111111111111111111` program
management and execution (see SIMD-0167).
- enable the loader-v3 `BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111`
instruction `UpgradeableLoaderInstruction::Migrate`.

### Loader-v3 Instruction: Migrate

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program data account.
  - `[writable]` The program account.
  - `[signer]` The migration authority.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `8u32`
- Behavior:
  - Check that there are at least three instruction accounts,
  otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Check that the program data account is writable,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the program data was last modified before the current slot
  if the program data has the state `ProgramData`,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the provided authority is either:
    - the migration authority
    (pubkey is `3Scf35jMNk2xXBD6areNjgMtXgp5ZspDhms8vdcbzC42`)
    - or the upgrade authority stored in the program data account
    - or the program signer if the program is finalized, closed or
    uninitialized
  otherwise throw `IncorrectAuthority`
  - Check that the provided authority is a signer,
  otherwise throw `MissingRequiredSignature`
  - Check that the program account is writable,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the program account is owned by loader-v3,
  otherwise throw `IncorrectProgramId`
  - Check that the program account has the state `Program`,
  otherwise throw `InvalidAccountData`
  - Check that the program account points to the program data account,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Clear the program account (setting its size to zero)
  - Transfer all funds from the program data account to the program account
  - Assign ownership of the program account to loader-v4
  - If the program data account was not closed / empty or uninitialized:
    - CPI loader-v4 `SetProgramLength` the program account to the size of the
    program data account minus the loader-v3 header size and use the migration
    authority.
    - CPI loader-v4 `Copy` the program data account into the program account
    - CPI loader-v4 `Deploy` the program account
    - If the program data account was finalized (upgrade authority is `None`):
      - CPI loader-v4 `Finalize` without a next version forwarding
    - otherwise, if the program data account was not finalized and the
    migration authority (as opposed to the upgrade authority) was provided:
      - CPI loader-v4 `TransferAuthority` to the upgrade authority
  - Clear the program data account (setting its size to zero)
  - Assign ownership of the program data account to the system program

## Impact

This changes enables the migration of programs from loader-v3 to loader-v4
without changing their program address via a new loader-v3 instruction. This
will count as a redeployment and thus render the program unavailable for the
rest of the slot (delay visibility).

Once new programs can not be deployed on loader-v3 anymore, the list of all
loader-v3 programs becomes fixed and can be extracted from a snapshot. Using
the added loader-v3 migration instruction and the global migration authority,
the core protocol developers will then migrate all loader-v3 programs to
loader-v4 programs, which once completed:

- removes the need to copy ELFs during program loading to align them.
- allows transaction account loading to be simplified, because every program
would load exactly one account, no need to load the proxy account to get to
the actual program data (which is not listed in the transaction accounts).
- allows the removal of the write lock demotion exception if loader-v3 is
present in a transaction.
- allows dApp devs to resuscitate closed loader-v3 programs if they still
control the program authority. This allows redeployment at the same address
or completely closing the program account in order to retrieve the locked
funds.

## Security Considerations

None.

## Backwards Compatibility

None.
