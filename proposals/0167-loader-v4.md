## Summary

A new upgradeable loader which only requires a single account per program.

## Motivation

Loader-v3, which is currently the only deployable loader, requires two accounts
per program. This was a workaround to circumvent the finality of the
`is_executable` flag, which is removed in SIMD-0162. Consequentially, this
setup of the program account being a proxy account, containing the address of
the actual program data account, is no longer necessary and should be removed.

Another issue with loader-v3 is that the executable file stored in the
programdata account is misaligned relative to the beginning of the account.

Additionally, there currently is no complete specification of the loaders
program management instructions. This proposal would thus fill that gap once
loader-v4 goes into production.

See impact for further motivation.

## Alternatives Considered

A delay-visibility-free redeployment could be achieved by keeping the swap
program around until the end of the slot. This would however mean that two
accounts per program must be loaded until the dapp developer reclaims the
second one. That would defy the purpose of this proposal which is to get rid
of the proxy account.

## New Terminology

None.

## Detailed Design

The feature gate `8Cb77yHjPWe9wuWUfXeh6iszFGCDGNCoFk3tprViYHNm` must:

- enable loader-v4 `LoaderV411111111111111111111111111111111111` program
management and execution.
- enable the loader-v3 `BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111`
instruction `UpgradeableLoaderInstruction::Migrate`.

An additional feature gate `EmhbpdVtZ2hWRGFWBDjn2i3SJD8Z36z4mpMcZJEnebnP`
must disable new deployments on loader-v3,
throwing `InvalidIstructionData` if `DeployWithMaxDataLen` is called.

### Owned Program Accounts

Accounts of programs owned by loader-v4 must have the following layout:

- Header (which is 48 bytes long):
  - `u64` Slot in which the program was last deployed, retracted or
  initialized.
  - `[u8; 32]` Authority address which can send program management
  instructions. Or if the status is finalized, then the address of the next
  version of the program.
  - `u64` status enum:
    - Enum variant `0u64`: Retracted, program is in maintenance
    - Enum variant `1u64`: Deployed, program is ready to be executed
    - Enum variant `2u64`: Finalized, same as `Deployed`, but can not be
    modified anymore
- Body:
  - `[u8]` The programs executable file

Verification the program account checks in the following order that:

- the owner of the program account is loader-v4,
otherwise throw `InvalidAccountOwner`
- the program account is at least as long enough for the header,
otherwise throw `AccountDataTooSmall`
- the program account is writable, otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
- the provided authority (instruction account at index 1) signed,
otherwise throw `MissingRequiredSignature`
- the authority stored in the program account is the one provided,
otherwise throw `IncorrectAuthority`
- the status stored in the program account is not finalized,
otherwise throw `Immutable`

### Execution / Invocation

Invoking programs owned by loader-v4 checks in the following order that:

- the owner of the program account is loader-v4
- the program account is at least as long enough for the header
- the status stored in the program account is not retracted
- the program account was not deployed within the current slot (delay
visibility)
- the executable file stored in the program account passes executable
verification

failing any of the above checks must throw `UnsupportedProgramId`.

### Program Management Instructions

All program management instructions must cost 2000 CUs.

#### Write

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program account to write to.
  - `[signer]` The authority of the program.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `0u32`
  - `u32` Byte offset at which to write the given bytes
  - `[u8]` Chunk of the programs executable file
- Behavior:
  - Check there are at least two instruction accounts,
  otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Verify the program account
  - Check the status stored in the program account is retracted,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the end offset (sum of offset and length of the chunk) does
  not exceed the maximum (program account length minus the header size),
  otherwise throw `AccountDataTooSmall`
  - Copy the chunk into the program account at the offset shifted by the
  header size

#### Copy

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program account to copy to.
  - `[signer]` The authority of the program.
  - `[]` The program(data) account to copy from.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `1u32`
  - `u32` Byte offset at which to write
  - `u32` Byte offset at which to read
  - `u32` Length of the chunk to copy in bytes
- Behavior:
  - Check there are at least three instruction accounts,
  otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Check that program account and source account do not alias,
  otherwise throw `AccountBorrowFailed`
  - Verify the program account
  - Check the status stored in the program account is retracted,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the source account is owned by loader v1, v2, v3 or v4,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - and look-up the source header size:
    - loader-v1: 0 bytes
    - loader-v2: 0 bytes
    - loader-v3: 45 bytes
    - loader-v4: 48 bytes
  - Check that the source end offset (sum of source offset and length) does
  not exceed the maximum (source account length minus the source header size),
  otherwise throw `AccountDataTooSmall`
  - Check that the destination end offset (sum of destination offset and
  length) does not exceed the maximum (program account length minus the loader-v4
  header size), otherwise throw `AccountDataTooSmall`
  - Copy the chunk between the program accounts at the offsets, each shifted by
  the header size of their loader (account owner) respectively

#### SetProgramLength

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[(signer), writable]` The program account to change the size of.
  - `[signer]` The authority of the program.
  - `[writable]` Optional, the recipient account.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `2u32`
  - `u32` The new size after the operation.
- Behavior:
  - Check there are at least two instruction accounts,
    otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - If this is an initialization (program account length is too short to
  contain the header and the requested new size is greater 0):
    - the owner of the program account is loader-v4,
    otherwise throw `InvalidAccountOwner`
    - the program account is writable, otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
    - the provided authority (instruction account at index 1) signed,
    otherwise throw `MissingRequiredSignature`
  - If this is not an initialization:
    - Verify the program account
    - Check that the status stored in the program account is retracted,
    otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that there are enough funds in the program account for rent
  exemption, otherwise throw `InsufficientFunds`
  - If there are more than enough funds:
    - Check there are at least three instruction accounts,
    otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
    - Check that the recipient account (instruction account at index 2) is
    writable, otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
    - If a recipient account was provided that is not the program account:
      - Transfer the surplus from the program account to the recipient account
    - otherwise, if the requested new size is zero throw `InvalidArgument`
  - If the requested new size is zero:
    - Delete the entire program account, including the header
  - If the requested new size is greater than zero:
    - Set the length of the program account to the requested new size plus
    the header size
    - In case that this is an initialization, also initialize the header:
      - Set the `is_executable` flag to `true`
      - Set the slot to zero, **not** the current slot
      - Set the authority address (from the instruction account at index 1)
      - Set the status to retracted

#### Deploy

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program account to deploy.
  - `[signer]` The authority of the program.
  - `[writable]` Optional, an undeployed source program account to take data
  and funds from.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `3u32`
- Behavior:
  - Check there are at least two instruction accounts,
    otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Verify the program account
  - Check that the slot stored in the program account is not the current
  (deployment cooldown), otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Note: The cooldown enforces that each pair of an address and a slot can
  uniquely identify a deployment of a program, which simplifies caching logic.
  - Check that the status stored in the program account is retracted
    otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - In case a source program was provided (instruction account at index 2)
  which is not the program account:
    - Verify the source program account
    - Check that the status stored in the source program account is retracted,
    otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
    - Check that the executable file stored in the source program account
    passes executable verification
      - The feature set that the executable file is verified against is not
      necessarily the current one, but the one of the epoch of the next slot
      - Also, during deployment certain deprecated syscalls are disabled,
      this stays the same as in the older loaders
    - Copy the entire source program account into the program account
    - Set the length of the source program account to zero
    - Swap the funds of the source program account and the program account.
    Note: This ensures correct amount for rent exemption (as it was calculated
    for the source program account) remains with the program account and the
    rest is deposited into the source program account to be retrieved. It works
    with programs growing, staying the same size or shrinking.
    - Assign ownership of the source program account to the system program
  - otherwise, if no source program was provided:
    - Check that the executable file stored in the program account passes
    executable verification
  - Change the slot in the program account to the current slot
  - Change the status stored in the program account to deployed

#### Retract

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program account to retract.
  - `[signer]` The authority of the program.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `4u32`
- Behavior:
  - Check there are at least two instruction accounts,
    otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Verify the program account
  - Check that the slot stored in the program account is not the current
  (deployment cooldown), otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the status stored in the program account is deployed,
    otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Note: The slot is **not** set to the current slot to allow a
  retract-modify-redeploy-sequence within the same slot or even within the
  same transaction.
  - Change the status stored in the program account to retracted

#### TransferAuthority

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program account to change the authority of.
  - `[signer]` The current authority of the program.
  - `[signer]` The new authority of the program.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `5u32`
- Behavior:
  - Check there are at least three instruction accounts,
    otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Verify the program account
  - Check that the new authority (instruction account at index 2)
  signed as well, otherwise throw `MissingRequiredSignature`
  - Check that the authority stored in the program account is different
  from the one provided, otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Copy the new authority address into the program account

#### Finalize

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program account to change the authority of.
  - `[signer]` The current authority of the program.
  - `[]` Optional, the reserved address for the next version of the program.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `6u32`
- Behavior:
  - Check there are at least three instruction accounts,
    otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Verify the program account
  - Check that the status stored in the program account is deployed,
    otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - for the program account of the next version
  (instruction account at index 2) check that:
    - the owner of the program account is loader-v4,
    otherwise throw `InvalidAccountOwner`
    - the program account is at least as long enough for the header,
    otherwise throw `AccountDataTooSmall`
    - the authority stored in the program account is the one provided,
    otherwise throw `IncorrectAuthority`
    - the status stored in the program account is not finalized,
    otherwise throw `Immutable`
  - Copy the address of the next version into the next version field stored in
  the previous versions program account
  - Change the status stored in the program account to finalized

### Loader-v3 Instruction: Migrate

- Instruction accounts:
  - `[writable]` The program data account.
  - `[writable]` The program account.
  - `[signer]` The migration authority.
- Instruction data:
  - Enum variant `8u32`
- Behavior:
  - Check that there are at least three instruction accounts,
  otherwise throw `NotEnoughAccountKeys`
  - Check that the program data account is writable,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the program data was last modified before the current slot
  if the program data has the state `ProgramData`,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the provided authority is either:
    - the migration authority
    (pubkey is `3Scf35jMNk2xXBD6areNjgMtXgp5ZspDhms8vdcbzC42`)
    - or the upgrade authority stored in the program data account
    - or the program signer if the program is finalized, closed or
    uninitialized
  otherwise throw `IncorrectAuthority`
  - Check that the provided authority is a signer,
  otherwise throw `MissingRequiredSignature`
  - Check that the program account is writable,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Check that the program account is owned by loader-v3,
  otherwise throw `IncorrectProgramId`
  - Check that the program account has the state `Program`,
  otherwise throw `InvalidAccountData`
  - Check that the program account points to the program data account,
  otherwise throw `InvalidArgument`
  - Clear the program account (setting its size to zero)
  - Transfer all funds from the program data account to the program account
  - If the program data account was closed / empty or uninitialized:
    - Assign ownership of the program account to the system program
  - otherwise, if the program data account contains actual program data:
    - Assign ownership of the program account to loader-v4
    - CPI loader-v4 `SetProgramLength` the program account to the size of the
    program data account minus the loader-v3 header size and use the migration
    authority.
    - CPI loader-v4 `Copy` the program data account into the program account
    - CPI loader-v4 `Deploy` the program account
    - If the program data account was finalized (upgrade authority is `None`):
      - CPI loader-v4 `Finalize` without a next version forwarding
    - otherwise, if the program data account was not finalized and the
    migration authority (as opposed to the upgrade authority) was provided:
      - CPI loader-v4 `TransferAuthority` to the upgrade authority
  - Clear the program data account (setting its size to zero)
  - Assign ownership of the program data account to the system program

## Impact

- This proposal covers all the use cases loader-v3 had but in a cleaner way and
comes with a specification.
- loader-v3 had a separate account type for buffers and extra commands for
these buffer accounts, in loader-v4 program accounts can act as buffers, there
is no more distinction.
- loader-v3 deployments always needed a buffer, in loader-v4 it is optional,
one can upload a redeployment into the program account directly.
- loader-v3 had two accounts per program, loader-v4 goes back to having only
one, thus needs less funds to reach rent exemption.
- loader-v3 closing of programs did finalize them, in loader-v4 all the funds
can be retrieved and the program address repurposed.
- loader-v3 programs could only grow, loader-v4 can shrink programs and also
retrieve the surplus of funds no longer required for rent exception.
- loader-v3 programs were always "live" after the first deployment, with
loader-v4 one can temporarily put a program into maintenance mode without a
redeployment.
- loader-v3 always required the entire program to be uploaded for a
redeployment, loader-v4 supports partial uploads for patching chunks of the
program.
- loader-v3 ELFs were misaligned, loader-v4 properly aligns the executable
file relative to the beginning of the account.
- loader-v4 allows finalized programs to mark which other program supersedes
them which can then be offered as an option in frontends. This provides a
more secure alternative to redeployment / upgrading of programs at the same
address. The keypair for the next version linked during finalization should be
generated beforehand.
- An option to migrate programs from loader-v3 to loader-v4 without changing
their program address will be available via a new loader-v3 instruction. This
will count as a redeployment and thus render the program unavailable for the
rest of the slot (delay visibility).

Once new programs can not be deployed on loader-v3 anymore, the list of all
loader-v3 programs becomes fixed and can be extracted from a snapshot. Using
the added loader-v3 migration instruction and the global migration authority,
the core protocol developers will then migrate all loader-v3 programs to
loader-v4 programs, which once completed:

- allows transaction account loading to be simplified, because every program
would load exactly one account, no need to load the proxy account to get to
the actual program data (which is not listed in the transaction accounts).
- allows the removal of the write lock demotion exception if loader-v3 is
present in a transaction.
- corrects the miscounting of the program data account size towards the total
transaction account loading limit.
- allows dApp devs to resuscitate closed loader-v3 programs if they still
control the program authority. This allows redeployment at the same address
or completely closing the program account in order to retrieve the locked
funds.

## Security Considerations

None.

## Backwards Compatibility
