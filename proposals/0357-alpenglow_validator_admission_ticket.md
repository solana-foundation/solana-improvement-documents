## Summary

This SIMD describes how the validator admission ticket (VAT) collection
described in [SIMD 326](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/326)
will be implemented. Specifically, how it affects validator operation
procedures.

Validator admission ticket is a mechanism translating the current cost of
voting into a similar economic equilibrium for Alpenglow. By charging every
voting validator 1.6 SOL per epoch, it replaces the current voting fee at ~2
SOLs per epoch, and reduces the likelyhood there are too many voting validators
immediately after Alpenglow launches.

Everything specified below are protocol-level changes, they need to be
implemented by all Solana clients. The client specific data structure
changes are omitted.

## Dependencies

The Validator Admission Ticket is specified in SIMD 326 (Alpenglow).

The compressed BLS Pubkey in Vote Account is specified in [SIMD 185 (Vote
Account v4)](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/185)

## Motivation

Adding more staked validators to a blockchain does come with costs. At the
very least, the votes and corresponding rewards need to be processed by
every voting validator. Therefore, every additional staked validator will
put a bit more pressure on the chain.

Right now every voting validator pays voting fee on any vote transaction
included in a block. The voting fee adds up to ~2 SOLs per epoch if the
validator votes most of the time. It is a burden, yet at the same time it's an
economic barrier to having too many voting validators on the chain.

Of course, VAT is only a temporary solution to maintain the current economic
equilibrium. This proposal intentionally strives to keep voting validator
protocol costs similar to pre-Alpenglow consensus.

## New Terminology

- **Validator Admission Ticket**: The 1.6 SOL charged once per epoch to every
validator eligible to participate in the next epoch

## Different Vote Related Accounts

Before Alpenglow, we have the following accounts related to voting (the
identity account and vote authority account can be the same):

- Vote account for saving all the vote states and receiving commission

- Identity account for receiving block rewards

- Vote authority account for signing vote transactions

After Alpenglow, we will still have roughly the same accounts serving the same
purpose:

- Vote account: This account must contain the correct BLS pubkey corresponding
to vote authority keypair; it continues to keep all the vote credits and all
validator identity/authority/commission information updates happen here, but
it doesnâ€™t contain vote information any more.

- Identity account: This is the account for the 1.6 SOL VAT; it continues
receiving block rewards and commissions.

- Vote authority account: For signing BLS messages

## Detailed Design

### What is considered valid vote account

The VAT discussion in SIMD 326 proposes:

- The VAT is a temporary measure before we implement a better mechanism

- There is a strict limit of the 2,000 highest staked validators

- Before being admitted to an epoch, the 1.6 SOL per epoch VAT fee is deducted
  from each validator and burned

Another requirement (not explicitly mentioned in SIMD 326 but in the Alpenglow
White Paper) is that Alpenglow uses BLS to aggregate signatures. So a future
Alpenglow vote account must contain a valid BLS pubkey deduced from its
current vote authority ed25519 private key.

In summary, a valid vote account in an Alpenglow epoch must contain:

- a BLS pubkey

- at least 1.6 SOL VAT fee plus the necessary storage rent amount for a new
epoch in its corresponding identity account

When the staked validators for a new epoch is calculated, the leader will
perform the following operations:

- When there are more than 2,000 valid validators, sort all valid vote accounts
by descending order of stake. We deterministically sort all validators by
stake. If some validator with stake S is in position 2001, then we remove all
validators with stake S and less. If there are fewer than 2,000 valid
validators, pick all of them.

- Deduct 1.6 SOL VAT fee from each picked vote identity account once

- Mark the fee burned and write the result into the bank

All validators must perform the same operation, or the resulting bankhash will
be different.

### How to implement the checks

1. When a new bank crosses the epoch boundary (bank.epoch() >
parent_bank.epoch()), we calculate the participating staked validators for the
next epoch (bank.epoch() + 1)

2. Perform stake activation and deactivation, so we will use the intended stake
for the new epoch

3. The calculation goes through all vote accounts and filter the following:

  - Contains at least 1.6 SOLs as balance in its corresponding identity account

  - Has a valid BLS Compressed Pubkey (can correctly decompress)

4. If the number of filtered accounts exceeds 2,000, then sort according to the
following rules and pick the top 2,000, otherwise return the whole list:

  - Sort by descending order of stake (largest to smallest)

  - If several validators have exactly the same amount of stake and including
  all of them would exceed the 2,000 limit, then all of them are excluded

5. Subtract 1.6 SOL from the corresponding vote identity account in the list of
accepted validators in the previous step

6. Record the VAT fee subtraction in the bank, it reduces bank capitalization.
This happens before any transaction is processed in the bank for the new epoch

7. The epoch stakes for epoch (bank.epoch() + 1) is generated from the list
generated in step 4. The epoch stakes are saved in bank snapshots, so if we
restart from a snapshot from any bank in the same epoch as bank.epoch(), the
1.6 SOLs fee will not be charged again

## Operation Considerations

- To be included in epoch e+1, validator operators must ensure the vote
identity account has at least 1.6 SOL before epoch e-1 ends

- Validator operators must ensure they have valid BLS pubkey specified in
their vote account

  - The ledger tools will be updated to verify validity of the BLS pubkey when
performing updates

  - We will not allow removing the BLS pubkey

  - The written BLS pubkey must be generated by the vote authority ed25519
keypair and change with the vote authority keypair, the keygen tools and
ledger tools will be updated

## Alternatives Considered

- Have all validators send a transaction to deduct 1.6 SOL VAT fee every epoch.
A few problems with this approach:

  - This transaction must land before the staked validators are selected

  - If this validator ends up not being selected, this VAT fee needs to be
returned, which means we have to implement some type of accounting and ensure
the VAT fee returning properly lands on the chain.

  - It does deduct an additional transaction fee from the vote account

  - If somehow validators make a mistake by sending multiple transactions,
we also need to return the fee collected.

## Impact

Validators not providing BLS Pubkey or desired fee will not be able to
participate in an Alpenglow epoch regardless of their stake. Also, only the
nodes selected by this process will receive votes or certificates from other
selected validators in real time.

## Security Considerations

Validator operators need to ensure they have enough fund and correct BLS
pubkey before end of epoch s to partipate in epoch s+2. This poses some new
operation challenges.

## Backwards Compatibility

This feature is not backwards compatible.
