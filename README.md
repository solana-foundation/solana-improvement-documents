# Solana Improvement Documents (SIMDs)

The goal of the SIMD project is to standardize and provide high-quality
documentation for Solana and its ecosystem. This repository tracks past and
ongoing improvements to Solana in the form of Solana Improvement Documents
(SIMDs).
[SIMD-0001](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md)
governs the SIMD process.

## SIMD Types

SIMDs can be divided into the following categories:

- **Standard SIMDs**:
  Describe changes that affect most or all Solana implementations, such as:
  - **Core**:
    Changes affecting consensus or substantial changes to the validator.
  - **Networking**:
    Changes or substantial improvements to network protocol specifications.
  - **Interfaces**:
    Breaking changes around the client JSON RPC API specifications and standards.
- **Meta SIMDs**:
  Describe a process surrounding Solana or propose a change to (or an event in)
  a process.

## Before You Begin

Before you write a SIMD, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed and vetted on the
[ideas section](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/discussions/categories/ideas)
within this
[repo's disucssion page](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/discussions).
Read and review [SIMD-0001](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md),
which describes the SIMD process in detail.

This repository is for documenting standards and not for implementation help.
For specific questions and concerns regarding SIMDs, it's best to discuss them
in the [questions section](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/discussions/categories/questions)
of this [repo's disucssion page](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/discussions).
